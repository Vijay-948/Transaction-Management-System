# Transaction-Management-System

Transaction Management System is a web application that manages transactions between users. It 
typically involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting transactions, as well as user 
authentication and authorization.

To implement a Transaction Management System web application using Spring Boot, I would typically 
start by defining the data model, which would include entities such as users, accounts, and transactions. 
You would then use Spring Data JPA to create repositories for each entity, which would provide 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
